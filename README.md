# CUM - **C**++ N**um**eric Library
Vendor agnostic C++ library providing linear algebra, eltwise operations, convenient datastructures and deep learning primitives without template hell (we moved the problems from the compile time to the runtime)

### CUM modules
* `cum/LinearAlgebra` - Classic BLAS routines and some convenience wrappers.
* `cum/functions` - Elementwise functions and some general stuff.
* `cum/neural_primitives` - Set of primitives for deep learning and N-Dimensional tensors operation.
* `cum/` - Memory and runtime management and `Vector`/`Matrix`/`Tensor` class

### Current development goal
* Working n-dimensional tensors
* Multi-device queue

### Known issues
* FP8 and lower floating point precision tensors didn't work and wouldn't for some time.
* Tensor class operator overloads and member functions aren't yet finished.
